# Assignment 3: Data Visualization (incarceration) 
# Create an analysis.R file to analyze dataframe and think about how the
# measures of incarceration vary by race 

# Load in packages to work with data 
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load in incarceration_trends.csv 
Incarceration_Trends <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vera-institute/incarceration-trends/master/incarceration_trends.csv")

# Calculate at least five summary values from the data 
# One

# Two

# Three

# Four

# Five

# Make a chart that shows trends over time for a variable of your choice 
# Show more than one but fewer than 10 lines. Your graph should compare the trend
# of your measure over time. This may mean showing the same measure for different locations,
# or different racial groups. Think careful about a meaningful comparison of locations (e.g the
# top 10 counties in a state, top 10 states, etc.)
# Must have clear x/y labels, a clear title, and a clear legend with different line colors



# Make a chart that compares two continuous variables to one another. Think carefully
# about what such a comparison means, and want to communicate to your user (you may have to find 
# relevant trends in the dataset first!)
# Must have clear x/y labels, clear title, if you choose to add color encoding (not required), you
# need a legend for your different color and a clear legend title 



# Make a map that shows how your measure of interests varies/is distributed  geographically.
# Think carefully about what such a comparison means, and want to communicate to your user
# Must have a title, color scale needs a legend with a clear label
# Use a map based coordinate system to set the aspect ratio of your map (see reading) 
# Use a minimalist theme for the map
