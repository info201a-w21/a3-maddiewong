# Introduction & Summary Information 
For my analysis of the Incarceration Trends data, I decided to focus on how differences in 
race and gender in the national incarcerated population were affected by the Violent Crime
Control and Law Enforcement Act, or the 1994 Crime Bill, which was imposed by the Clinton
Administration. My analysis file mainly focuses on differences in the amount of male vs.
female inmates who were incarcerated as well as the proportions of total inmates before and 
after the 1994 Crime Bill. Additionally, I decided to calculate changes in the number of 
Black inmates before and after 1994. I believe that an analysis of this data can provide
insights on information regarding the differences between the incarceration of People of 
Color compared to caucasian populations. Furthermore, my interest in the effects of the 
War on Drugs and War on Crime motivated me to look at incarceration rates specifically from
this time period.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
